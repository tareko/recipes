2 Tablespoons butter
3 Eggs
1 1/2 cups milk
3/4 cups flour
1/3 cup sugar
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp vanilla

Topping
3 cups fruit
2 Tbsp sugar


* Preheat oven to 375.
* Place butter in a 9" pie pan and place in oven to melt.

* In blender, mix eggs and milk.

* Add flour, sugar, salt and vanilla. Beat until smooth.

* Pour into pie pan and bake until edges are golden brown and centre is set, 30 minutes. 

* Mix 3 cups fruit with 2T sugar. (I use a different combination every time: pears and wild blueberries, nectarines and blackberries - whatever's in the kitchen on Saturday morning.)

* Spoon fruit mixture onto souffle. Cut into wedges. Serve topped with whipped cream, vanilla yogurt, sour cream, or whatever you like.
