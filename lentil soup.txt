    Rinse and soak lentils in water for 1-2 hours.
    Drain the water off.
    In a pot heat 2 tablespoons olive oil.
    Saute the onions until soft.
    Add the lentils and sprinkle them with 1 tablespoon of flour, stir for a couple of minutes.
    Add the water or the stock, stir to make sure that the flour dissolved completely.
