# Jim’s Philly Cheesesteak Recipe

## Part 1 – The Hoagie Rolls

I basically follow Ethan Chlebowski’s recipe for this. It makes four rolls. The secret ingredient is the Diastatic Malt Powder, which you can order on Amazon. Here’s the breakdown:

### Ingredients

- 260 g Milk
- 6 g Instant Dry Yeast
- 8 g Diastatic Malt powder
- 400 g Bread Flour (All-Purpose Flour works too – That’s what I usually use)
- 10 g Honey
- 20 g Olive Oil
- 8 g Salt
- Egg wash: 1 egg white + a spoonful of water
- Cornmeal for sprinkling

### Method

#### 1. Mix the Dough

- Warm 260 g milk in the microwave for about 50 seconds. Ideally, the temperature should be between 105-110°F to optimize yeast activity.
- Add 6 g of yeast, along with 8 g of Diastatic Malt powder, and stir to combine. Let stand for 3-5 minutes until light foam surfaces and bubbles are visible.
- Meanwhile, add 400 g flour, 10 g honey, 20 g olive oil, and 8 g of salt to a large mixing bowl. Once the yeast has proofed, pour in the mixture and vigorously mix the dough with your hands until no dry flour remains, and a cohesive mass forms (about 2 minutes).
- Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 15 minutes.

*Note: Resting will allow the flour to start hydrating all on its own, and make the dough a little bit easier to work with when kneading.*

#### 2. Kneading (Gluten development)

- Once rested, turn the dough out onto a clean counter and knead for 8-10 minutes.
- After kneading the dough, cut off a piece and test for gluten development by carefully stretching the dough very thin to check for a see-through “window” before tearing.

*Note: The gluten window test is the key to understanding if the flour has been hydrated enough, which is how gluten is developed. If the dough tears before getting to a slightly translucent window, continue kneading for another couple of minutes.*

#### 3. Bulk Ferment (1st Ferment)

- Once done kneading, add the dough to the mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in size. About 60 minutes.

#### 4. Divide Dough + Shape Rolls + Proof (2nd Ferment)

- Once doubled in size, punch the dough down and divide into 4 equal portions (roughly 175g each).
- Cover the dough balls with plastic and let them rest for 15 minutes. This will make it easier to shape them.
- Once rested, it’s time to shape the rolls. Using your fingertips, lightly press and stretch a piece of dough into a rectangle, about 8 inches wide. Tightly roll the dough from the bottom to the top. Press and seal the seam created on the bottom of the roll. Now, you should have a log of dough with the seam side down.
- Applying even pressure with the palm of your hands in the center of the dough begin gently rolling the log out into a cylinder (about 10 inches long).
- Evenly, and generously, sprinkle a 1:1 mixture of cornmeal and flour onto a parchment paper covered baking sheet, and place the four rolls on there to rest. Cover lightly with plastic wrap and let the rolls proof for another 60 minutes.

#### 5. Oven Set Up

- With 15 minutes of proofing left, preheat the oven to 375°F. Place an oven-safe pan or another baking sheet on the bottom rack of the oven.

*Note: Ice will be dropped on the hot pan to help create a steamy environment for better oven spring.*

#### 6. Bake

- Using a razor, or really sharp knife, score the hoagie rolls with one long slash along the length of each roll, to allow for oven spring.
- Whisk the egg white and spoonful of water together. Using a brush, lightly spread the egg wash on the exterior of each roll to give it a better crust.
- Sprinkle some cornmeal over the top of each roll.

*Note: At this point, you can sprinkle on toppings like sesame seeds, or other herbs and spices, if you like.*

- Place the rolls into the oven, on the middle rack
- Add some ice cubes (I usually add the whole tray) to the pan on the bottom rack, which has been preheating all this time. Adding this ice will create steam, which is the goal.
- Bake for 10-11 minutes, then rotate the pan. Continue baking for another 10-11 minutes until the crust is golden brown. In my oven I do it for 22 minutes total, and it works perfectly.
- Let the rolls cool completely on a wire rack.

## Part 2 – The Cheese Sauce

This cheese sauce recipe could also be used to make an excellent cheese dip for nachos, or anything that requires smooth, melted cheese. The secret ingredient is Sodium Citrate, which you can order on Amazon. It acts as an emulsifier, which is the key. Because of the Sodium Citrate, you can basically melt any type of cheese easily, including hard or aged cheeses.

### Ingredients

- 1/4 Cup (about 80 mL) Milk
- 2 Tablespoons of butter
- 1 cup (100 g) of grated Provolone cheese. I use Provolone Dolce rather than Piccante.
- 1 teaspoon (4 g) Sodium Citrate

### Method

- In a cold pot, combine the milk, cheese, butter and sodium citrate.
- Start melting everything together on Medium-High heat and stir constantly.
- Once it’s totally melted and simmering, you’re done.

## Part 3 – The Steak Filling

### Ingredients

- 1 Ribeye/Rib Steak (about 1 lb of meat). This is usually enough for two sandwiches.
- 1 Medium Onion, Diced.
- Salt to taste
- 2 Tablespoons of Beef Tallow (Ghee is a good substitute).

*Note: I use Ghee or Clarified Butter, since I can’t find Beef Tallow, but all of the best steak shops in Philly use Beef Tallow.*

### Method

- Put the meat into the freezer for about 2 hours to firm up.
- Once the meat has firmed up, use a mandoline slicer set to 1/16”, to slice up the meat. You can also use a sharp chef’s knife for this. The key is to get the meat sliced nice and thin.
- Finely dice the onion.
- Heat up a pan to Medium/Medium-High heat, and add the 2 Tbsps of Beef Tallow or Ghee.
- Add the diced onion to the pan. At this point, add a pinch of salt to the onions.
- Once the onions start to soften, and become slightly translucent, take them out of the pan and set aside.
- Now add the meat to the pan. Do not add salt yet.
- While cooking the meat, use a spatula to break down the meat slices even further. The idea is to get the meat chopped up into heterogeneous chunks.
- Once the meat is no longer pink, add a pinch of salt and stir.
- Add the cooked onions to the meat, and stir for a bit.
- Add about half of your cheese sauce to the meat and onion mixture, and stir well. Let everything cook for a bit, until you notice that there isn’t a lot of liquid left in the pan. That should only take a few minutes.

## Part 4 – Sandwich Assembly

- Slice the Hoagie Rolls along their length, but not all of the way through. You basically want a pocket to hold the filling.
- Generously fill each roll with the meat mixture.
- Top off with a few spoonfuls of the cheese sauce.
- Enjoy!
