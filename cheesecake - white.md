Cook time in red dish: 50 mins

# Ingredients
## Crust
* 2 cups finely ground graham crackers (about 30 squares)
* 14-16 crackers of the rectangles
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1 stick unsalted butter, melted

## Filling
* 1 pound cream cheese, two 8-ounce blocks, softened
* 3 eggs
* 200g sugar
* 500mL sour cream
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 lemon, zested

## Warm Lemon Blueberry Topping
* 1 pint blueberries
* 1 lemon, zested and juiced
* 2 tablespoons sugar


# Directions
* Preheat the oven to 162°C (325°F)

## Crust
* In a mixing bowl, combine the ingredients with a fork until evenly moistened. Lightly coat the bottom and sides of an 8-inch springform pan with non-stick cooking spray.
* Pour the crumbs into the pan and, using the bottom of a measuring cup or the smooth bottom of a glass, press the crumbs down into the base and 1-inch up the sides. Refrigerate for 5 minutes.

## Filling
* In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese on low speed for 1 minute until smooth and free of any lumps.
* Add the eggs, 1 at a time, and continue to beat slowly until combined. 
* Gradually add sugar and beat until creamy, for 1 to 2 minutes.
* Add sour cream, lemon zest, and vanilla. Periodically scrape down the sides of the bowl and the beaters. The batter should be well-mixed but not over-beaten. Pour the filling into the crust-lined pan and smooth the top with a spatula.
* Set the cheesecake pan on a large piece of aluminum foil and fold up the sides around it. Place the cake pan in a large roasting pan. 
* Pour boiling water into the roasting pan until the water is about halfway up the sides of the cheesecake pan; the foil will keep the water from seeping into the cheesecake.
* Bake for time as above. The cheesecake should still jiggle (it will firm up after chilling), so be careful not to overcook. 
* Let cool in pan for 30 minutes. Chill in the refrigerator, loosely covered, for at least 4 hours.
 
* Loosen the cheesecake from the sides of the pan by running a thin metal spatula around the inside rim. Unmold and transfer to a cake plate. Using a spatula spread a layer of Warm Lemon Blueberry topping over the surface.
* Slice the cheesecake with a thin, non-serrated knife that has been dipped in hot water. Wipe dry after each cut.
