Makes 4 small pans or one springform pan

# Ingredients
## Crust

* 2 1/2 cups (250 grams) fudge filled cookie crumbs, about 30 sandwich cookies - full box of fudgee-o's. Blend them 5 at a time in the vitamix, and empty out about halfway through.
* 86g (6 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted

## Filling

* 750 g cream cheese, softened (3 blocks)
* 3/4 cup (180 milliliters) heavy cream
* 150 g sugar
* 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 560 g Nutella
* 4 large eggs, lightly beaten

## Glaze

* 1 cup (280 grams) Nutella
* 1/2 cup (120 milliliters) heavy cream

# Instructions
## Crust

* Adjust the oven rack to the lower third position and preheat the oven to 350ºF. Wrap the outer bottom of a 9-inch springform pan tightly with aluminum foil. Combine the cookie crumbs and melted butter. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom and about 2-inches up the sides of the pan. Bake for 10 minutes. Set aside to cool while you make the filling.

## Filling

* Reduce the oven temperature to 300ºF. 
* In a large mixing bowl beat the cream cheese, heavy cream, and sugar with an electric mixer until smooth and fluffy. 
* Add the vanilla and salt, beat on low speed until smooth. 
* Add the Nutella and beat until well incorporated. 
* Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Using a silicone spatula, gently stir in the eggs just until combined. 
* Pour the batter over the crust in the prepared pan. Place the cheesecake inside a roasting pan. Fill the roasting pan with enough hot water to reach halfway up the sides of the cheesecake pan. (Alternatively, you can place the roasting pan filled with water on the lower rack of the oven.)
* Bake for time as above, OR until the edges are set and the center is slightly jiggly. Turn the oven off, leave the cheesecake in the water bath in the oven for another hour.
* Remove the cheesecake from the water bath and run a small knife around the outer edge of the cheesecake to loosen it from the pan. Allow it to cool completely to room temperature. (The cheesecake should not feel the slightest bit warm.) Refrigerate the cheesecake overnight.

## Glaze

* Remove the sides of the pan and place the cheesecake on a wire rack set over a baking sheet.
* Bring the cream to a low boil over medium-low heat. Pour the warm cream over the Nutella in a medium bowl and stir to combine. 
* Pour the glaze over the top of the cheesecake and use an offset spatula to smooth it over, allowing the glaze to run over the edge and down the sides of the cheesecake. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or until the glaze has set.

Make ahead tip

* The baked and chilled cheesecake will keep for up to 4 days covered tightly and stored in the refrigerator.
* The cheesecake will keep for up to 2 months covered tightly and stored in the freezer. Cut frozen and let the slices sit at room temperature for 15-30 minutes before serving.

Notes

1. The texture of this cheesecake is softer and creamier than a typical cheesecake. It's more like a thick, silky mousse.

Because of this, the cheesecake will be easiest to slice when very cold or frozen. But, allow the slices to sit at room temperature for 20-30 minutes before serving for optimal texture.

2. The total time represents total rest and chill time. Plan ahead when making this recipe.

3. Heavy cream is necessary. Do not attempt to use milk in place of it.

4. Do not attempt to make this in a regular cake pan. First, regular cake pans are not tall enough to hold all the batter. Second, this cheesecake is mousse-like in texture and you will have one hell of a time trying to remove it from the pan.

Baking variation:

* Bake the cheesecake in 24 muffin cups lined with paper for 20-25 minutes. Turn the oven off and leave them in for another hour.

Oven temps can vary which means your cheesecake may need more time to bake. You'll know it is done cooking when the outer edges of the cheesecake feel firm to the touch while the center looks wet and jiggles when shaken. If the cheesecake doesn't look this way after an hour of cooking, let it cook until it does. Then you can turn the oven off and let the cheesecake rest for another hour in the oven.
