# Fried Chicken

# Ingredients

* 8 pieces bone-in chicken, preferably drumsticks and thighs
* 1 tablespoons plus 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided
 * 1 tablespoon plus 1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika
 * 1 tablespoon ground white pepper
 * 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder
 * 1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
 * 1 1/2 teaspoons celery salt
 * 1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
 * 1 1/2 teaspoons ground mustard
 * 1 teaspoon dried thyme
 * 1 teaspoon dried basil
 * 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tablespoon cornstarch
* 1 cup buttermilk
* 2 large egg whites
* 2 quarts peanut or vegetable oil, for deep frying


# Instructions
* Salt the chicken. Place 8 bone-in chicken pieces on a baking sheet and sprinkle all over with 1 tablespoon of the salt. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes or cover loosely and refrigerate overnight.

* Make the seasoning blend. Place 1 tablespoon plus 1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika, 1 tablespoon ground white pepper, 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder, 1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger, 1 1/2 teaspoons celery salt, 1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, 1 1/2 teaspoons ground mustard, 1 teaspoon dried thyme, 1 teaspoon dried basil, and 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano in a large bowl and stir to combine.

* Season the chicken. Coat the chicken all over with half of the seasoning mixture (about 3 tablespoons).

* Set up a dredging station. Add 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 tablespoon cornstarch, and the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt to the remaining spice mixture in the bowl and whisk to combine. Place 1 cup buttermilk, 2 large egg whites, and 2 tablespoons vodka in a medium bowl and whisk to combine. Fit a wire rack over a second rimmed baking sheet.

* Dredge the chicken. Working with 1 piece of chicken at a time, dip in the buttermilk mixture to completely coat, then place in the flour mixture (don't worry about letting any excess buttermilk drain off the chicken first). Shake the flour bowl as needed to completely coat the chicken, then use your fingers to press the flour coating onto the chicken.

* Set the coating. Place the coated chicken on the rack. Let sit at room temperature for at least 10 minutes and up to 30 minutes while you set up for frying and heat the oil for the coating to set up.

* Set up for frying. Meanwhile, place 2 quarts vegetable or peanut oil in a large Dutch oven and heat on medium-high heat until 350째F. Meanwhile, wash and dry the empty baking sheet the chicken was seasoned on. Line this baking sheet with paper towels and fit with a second wire rack; this will be your cooling station.

* Fry the chicken. Place 3 pieces of the chicken in the oil and fry, using tongs to flip or rotate the pieces every 3 to 4 minutes and adjusting the heat as needed to maintain 325째F, until golden-brown with an internal temperature of 165째F (check by inserting a probe thermometer into the thickest part of the chicken without touching bone), 12 to 15 minutes total.

* Cool the chicken. Transfer the chicken to the rack on the second baking sheet. Make sure the oil comes back up to 350째F before frying the remaining chicken in 2 more batches. Let cool for at least 10 minutes before serving.
