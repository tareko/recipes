Ingredients

    8 ounces flat rice noodles
    3 Tablespoons oil
    3 cloves garlic, minced
    8 ounces uncooked shrimp, chicken, or extra-firm tofu , cut into small pieces
    2 eggs
    1 cup fresh bean sprouts
    1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
    3 green onions, chopped
    1/2 cup dry roasted peanuts
    2 limes
    1/2 cup Fresh cilantro, chopped

For the Pad Thai sauce:

    2 tsp fish sauce
    1 tsp low-sodium soy sauce
    50g brown sugar
    2 tsp vinegar (may use 2 Tablespoons rice vinegar or tamarind paste)
    1 Tablespoon Sriracha hot sauce , or more, to taste
    2 Tablespoons creamy peanut butter , optional

Instructions

    Cook noodles according to package instructions, just until tender.  Rinse under cold water.
    Mix the sauce ingredients together. Set aside.
    Heat 1Â½ tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan or wok over medium-high heat.
    Add the shrimp, chicken or tofu, garlic and bell pepper. The shrimp will cook quickly, about 1-2 minutes on each side, or until pink. If using chicken, cook until just cooked through, about 3-4 minutes, flipping only once.
    Push everything to the side of the pan. Add a little more oil and add the beaten eggs. Scramble the eggs, breaking them into small pieces with a spatula as they cook.
    Add noodles, sauce, bean sprouts and peanuts to the pan (reserving some peanuts for topping at the end). Toss everything to combine.
    Top with green onions, extra peanuts, cilantro and lime wedges. Serve immediately!

Notes
To use tamarind paste in the sauce, substitute 2 Tablespoons in place of the vinegar.
