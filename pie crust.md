# Pie Crust

## Ingredients
* 170g 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) very cold unsalted butter
* 360 g all-purpose flour
* 2.5 g kosher salt
* 12 g sugar
* 120 mL ice water
* 160 g very cold vegetable shortening (Crisco)

## Directions
* Dice the butter and return it to the refrigerator while you prepare the flour mixture. 
* Place the flour, salt, and sugar in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade and pulse a few times to mix.
* Add the butter and shortening. 
* Pulse 8 to 12 times, until the butter is the size of peas. 
* With the machine running, pour the ice water down the feed tube and pulse the machine until the dough begins to form a ball. 
* Dump out on a floured board and roll into a ball.
* Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. 

* Cut the dough in half.
* Roll each piece on a well-floured board into a circle, rolling from the center to the edge, turning and flouring the dough to make sure it doesn't stick to the board.
* Fold the dough in half, place in a pie pan, and unfold to fit the pan.
* Repeat with the top crust.
