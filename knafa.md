Knafa khishna

**Cook time:** 10 minutes in small individual metal pans
**Makes:** 2 small metal pans

## Syrup (attar)
* 100g sugar
* 50g water
* 2.5 mL lemon
* 5 mL orange blossom water
* 2.5 mL rose water

* Combine sugar, water and squeeze of lemon juice. Set on the stove top over medium high heat. Avoid stirring.
* Bring to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for 5 minutes.
* Allow to cool to room temperature before using.

## Crust
* 100g kunafa (aka kataifi dough), fresh or frozen
* ~~25g semolina flour~~ Ignore for now.
* 50g melted ghee (or clarified butter *instructions below)
* 20g scented sugar syrup
* 25g water
* 30g ghee or clarified butter, at room temperature, for cooking the knafeh

* Ground pistachios, for garnish


## Cheese filling
* 200g Mozarella
* 100g Akkawi

* Thinly slice both the Mozarella and akkawi cheese. Place each kind of cheese in a separate bowl and cover with lukewarm tap water to remove the saltiness. Allow the cheese to soak for 2 to 6 hours, changing the water every 1/2 hour, until the cheese is no longer salty to the taste. Amount of soaking time will vary depending on the cheese's salt content, which is why they are placed in separate bowl. This step can be done overnight, but in that case, keep the cheese bowls in the refrigerator.
* Drain both cheeses through a colander, squeezing them with your hand or back of a spoon to remove any excess liquid. Crumble both cheeses together with your hands or in food processor to evenly combine. Set aside in the colander to release any excess moisture, as you prepare the knafeh crust (farkeh).
