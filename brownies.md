* 8 ounces granulated sugar
* 8 ounces dark brown sugar
* ½ fluid ounce vanilla extract
* 4 ounces all-purpose flour

* Parchment paper
* Whisk
* Large wooden spoon
* Rubber spatulas
* Off-set spatula
* Scale 

## Directions
### Caramel
* Line a 13 x 9-inch pan with parchment paper, lightly buttered.
* In a medium saucepan (make sure it is completely dry) over medium-high heat, melt the sugar. Use a spatula to break up any large chunks of sugar but then stop stirring and let the sugar melt on its own, undisturbed. Takes about 8-10 minutes.
* Once all the sugar is melted, and it has reached a deep amber color remove from the heat.
* Gradually whisk in the butter until it is dissolved.
* Stir in the cream, bourbon and salt. Return the pan to the stove to incorporate all of the ingredients and to a low simmer to make sure all the sugar crystals have dissolved completely. Once the caramel bubbles slightly and reaches a dark amber color remove from the stove.
* Pour the caramel into the parchment lined sheet tray and transfer the tray into a freezer. Freeze for at least one hour. Depending on the humidity in your freezer you may need more or less time for the caramels to solidify.

### Brownies:

* Heat oven to 350 degrees F.
* Line a 13 x 9x 2-inch pan with two pieces of over lapping parchment paper, make sure the parchment continues up the sides of the pan. Butter the parchment (you can also use non-stick spray if easier)
* Bring a saucepan of water to boil and turn off heat. Combine butter and chocolate in a heat proof bowl and set over the pan of water, stirring occasionally until completely melted. Take off the heat and set aside to cool.
* In the bowl of a standing mixer combine the sugar, brown sugar, and salt. Gradually add the eggs, scraping the sides after each addition. Add the vanilla.
* Stir in chocolate butter mixture until combine.
* Add in flour, be careful not to over-mix.
* Pour ¾ of the batter into prepared pan.
* Pull-out tray of caramels from the freezer and either cut into 1-inch squares or if caramel is still soft, use a 1-inch ball scooper and scoop balls of caramel onto a tray.
* Drop ¾ of the caramels through-out the batter. Pour the remaining batter over the caramels. Scatter the remaining caramels on top.

* Bake in the middle rack of the oven for about 45 min.

* To cut brownies, once they have cooled to room temp- stick in the freezer for 30 min or until firm. This will allow you to cut the brownies into perfect squares. Add ice cream or whipped cream for a delicious and cool topping to the warm brownie, drizzle with extra caramel.
