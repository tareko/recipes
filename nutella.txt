    226 grams hazelnuts or filberts
    ½ teaspoon vanilla
    ¼ teaspoon salt
    40g powdered sugar
    20g cocoa powder
    170 grams semi-sweet chocolate (bars work best)
    1 tablespoon oil (see notes)

Directions:

    Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350ºF.
    Place the hazelnuts on a baking tray and spread them out into a single layer. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until they brown lightly. Remove the tray at the 5 minute mark and give the nuts a toss for evening browning. Let the nuts cool for 10 minute before proceeding.
    Place the hazelnuts on a kitchen or tea towel and rub vigorously with hands or on a smooth surface to help loosen the skin. If some of the skin doesn’t come off, that’s okay. Melt the chocolate in the microwave in 20 second increments, stopping the microwave and stirring in between until the chocolate melts. Mine took about 40 seconds.
    Add the hazelnuts to a food processor and let the processor run for 2-3 minutes or until a smooth, glossy paste forms. Add the vanilla, salt, cocoa powder, melted chocolate, and ⅓ cup powdered sugar for less sweet nutella at ½ cup for sweeter nutella. Let the food processor run for 1 ½ – 2 minutes while you slowly drizzle in the oil through the food processor opening. Keep in mind the nutella will be runny when you stop the machine but will thicken as it cools.
    Place nutella in a mason jar or any resealable container and keep at room temperature for up to 1 month (if it actually lasts that long!)

Notes:

    For the oil, I suggest using a nut/seed oil such as almond, walnut, hazelnut, or sunflower. If you can’t find these, other options are coconut, corn, vegetable.
    Though chocolate chips will work for this recipe, I always find that they are harder to melt than chocolate bars broken into pieces.
