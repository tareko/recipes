    1 can (15 oz.) pumpkin puree
    3 eggs
    3/4 cup heavy/whipping cream
    2/3 cup  brown sugar
    1 tbs cornstarch
    1 tsp cinnamon
    1 tsp ginger
    1/4 tsp nutmeg
    1/4 tsp cloves
    2 tsp vanilla extract 
    
    Heat oven to 325°. Combine all ingredients in a medium mixing bowl and stir until well combined and smooth. Pour into prepared crust and bake 50-60 minutes, until the pie just just the slightest wobble in the center when you jiggle it, but it set around the edges. Cool pie and place candied pecans around the edge. Serve with whipped cream or ice cream.
