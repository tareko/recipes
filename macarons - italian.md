# Ingredients
* 130 g finely grounded almond flour
* 130 g icing sugar
* Syrup:
 * 120g powdered sugar
 * 40g water
* 50g egg whites - first bowl
* 50g egg whites + food colouring - second bowl

# Meringue
* Whip egg whites using whisk attachment at high speed until it has stiff peaks
* Separately, heat the syrup (water + powdered sugar) to 118°C
* Pour heated syrup on the wall of the mixer bowl without direct contact with the whisk. Continue to whip the mixture at maximal speed for 5 minutes to get a meringue.

# Dry ingredients
* Mix equal parts almond flour and the icing sugar
* Mix the contents of the second bowl of egg whites to get an almond paste


# Macaronage
* Incorporate the almond paste and the meringue with a spatula and finish the mixing with a
pastry horn to get the macaron batter
* Stop the macaronage when the mixture forms a continuous strip or flattens immediately into
an even disk when poured. Transfer then the macaron batter into a piping bag fitted with a plain
round tip.

# Baking
* Preheat a convection oven at 140°C (290°F) for 10 minutes
* Prepare a template paper with 3cm circles, spacing them at least 2cm apart
* Place 4 dots of the batter in each corner of a rimmed baking sheet. Place the template paper on the baking sheet then place the parchment paper over it
* Pipe the macarons onto the parchment paper, in 3 cm circles filing the templated circles
* Bake the macarons in the oven for 25 to 30 minutes.
* When the macarons are well baked (set but not browning), remove them from the oven and let them dry for 10 minutes at ambient temperature

# Sealing the Macarons
1. Detach the macarons shells from the parchment paper and match them 2 by 2 by diameter size
2. Take your ganache out of the refrigerator and pour it in a piping bag. Pour some ganache on the flat size of one of the paired shells, and then seal the macaron with the second shell
3. In order to optimize texture and flavour, let your macarons rest a whole night into the refrigerator
