# Ingredients
* Equal parts:
 * 65 gr (2.7 oz.) of finely grounded almond flour
 * 65 gr (2.7 oz.) of icing sugar
* Syrup:
 * 60gr (2.5 oz) of powdered sugar
 * 20 gr (1 oz.) of water
* 25 gr (1 oz.) of egg whites - first bowl
* 25 gr(1 oz.) of egg whites + food colouring - second bowl

# Method
1. Mix with a robot with the blade tool with together in equal parts the almond flour and the icing
sugar.
2. Pour in the mixer bowl the content of the “1 st bowl” (i.e. egg whites). At the same time, start
heating the syrup (water + powdered sugar) beyond boiling point and up to 110°C (230°F).
3. When the temperature of the syrup reaches that point, and as the temperature continues to rise
slowly up to 118°C (245°F), start whipping the egg whites until the whisk leaves prints in the
cream.
4. Once the syrup reaches 118°C, pour it on the wall of the mixer bowl without direct contact with
the whisk. Continue to whip the mixture at maximal speed for 5 minutes to get a “meringue”.
5. Meanwhile, mix the content of the “2 nd bowl” (egg whites) with the “tant pour tant” (i.e. the
mixed almond flour and icing sugar) to get a bowl of “almond paste”
6. Incorporate the “almond paste” to the « meringue » with the spatula and finish the mixing with a
pastry horn (“macaronage”) to get the macaron batter.
7. Stop the « macaronage » when the mixture forms a continuous strip or flattens immediately into
an even disk when poured. Transfer then the macaron batter into a piping bag fitted with a plain
round tip.
8. Preheat a convection oven at 140°C (290°F) for 10 minutes. Prepare a template paper with circles
calibres of 3 cm (1.5 inch), spacing them at least 2 cm (1 inch) apart
9. Place 4 dots of the batter in each corner of a rimmed baking sheet. Place the template paper on
the baking sheet then place the parchment paper over it, using the batter to help the parchment
adhering to the baking sheet.
10. Pipe the macarons onto the parchment paper, in 3 cm circles filing the calibres and respecting the
2 cm spacing. When all the macarons are poured, remove the calibres and keep only the
parchment paper attached to the baking sheet. Put the whole in the convection oven.
11. Bake the macarons in the oven for 25 to 30 minutes.
12. When the macarons are well baked (set but not browning), remove them from the oven and let
them dry for 10 minutes at ambient temperature

# Chocolate Ganache
# Ingredients
* 100 gr (3.5 oz.) of black chocolate
* 100 gr (3.5 oz.) of liquid full cream

# Method
1. Heat the liquid cream until boiling point
2. Put the black chocolate into a bowl.
3. Pour in 3 times the cream over the chocolate and mix with a spatula
4. Cool the mixture 1 to 2 hours at ambient temperature, until all heat has completely gone.
5. Cool the mixture for at least 3 hours in the refrigerator.

# Final step: sealing the Macarons
1. Detach the macarons shells from the parchment paper and match them 2 by 2 by diameter size.
2. Take your ganache out of the refrigerator and pour it in a piping bag. Pour some ganache on the
flat size of one of the paired shells, and then seal the macaron with the second shell.
3. In order to optimize texture and flavour, let your macarons rest a whole night into the refrigerator.
