Matcha tea Tiramis√π

Ingredients:
4 eggs - separate
1/2 cup sugar
500ml Mascarpone
1/4 tsp salt (optional)
Cocoa (optional)

Savoiardi - full package
Matcha Tea mix - 3 teaspoons in 250mL of boiling water, allow to cool.

I much prefer a tiramisu with whipped egg whites and yolks. You'll see some recipes with whipped cream or cream cheese, because some people are pussies and are afraid of unpasturized egg.

* Whisk the yolk with about 1/4 cup sugar until pale and almost frothy.
* Whip about the mascarpone (I always work at room temp).
* Combine the yolk mix with the whipped mascarpone until smooth.
* Whip the 4 egg whites and about halfway through add about 1/4 cup sugar and continue until stiff. You could add the salt if you like.

* Gently fold egg whites into the mascarpone-yolk-sugar mixture.

* Dip savoiradi into tea mix. It's only a quick dip because the cookies will continue absorbing and you don't want them to end up soggy, runny or mushy

Assembly:
* Lay the dipped savoiardi into casserole dish or Pyrex, about 13x9
* Spread a layer of mascarpone cream mix
* Lay another layer of savoiardi. This can be done perpendicular to the first layer
* Cream mix again
* Cocoa on top (optional)

* Chill in the fridge for 6 hours. May also put in the freezer for 90 minutes, then transfer to fridge.


From this base you can veer into different directions ... with chocolate zabaglione, etc, but i keep it simple.

One note - try to use eggs with a pale yellow yolk over those with a deep yellow or orange yolk. Either way, go fresh. 

The deep coloured yolk makes your cream look like it has a yellowish tint to it, which is a little off putting. You will think you've done something wrong. If not you, others will. Purely aesthetic, but go light yellow yolk if you have those.
