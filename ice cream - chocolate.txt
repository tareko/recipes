Ingredients

These ingredients results in 950 grams of ice cream base and is roughly the quantity needed for a single run of most ice cream machines.

* 525 grams double cream (35% fat) (1050g double)
* 77 grams whole milk (3.4% fat) (144g double)
* 35 grams skim milk powder (70g double)
* 152 grams sugar (304g double)
* 86 grams egg yolks (172g double)
* 76 grams cocoa mass (152g double)
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (2 tsp double)
* 0.24 grams salt (0.48g double)

Note on cocoa mass: The rich and non-sweet character of this ice cream is due to using cocoa mass instead of chocolate. I use cocoa mass from Callebaut, but it can be hard to find a supplier. Some alternatives are available through Amazon. If you cannot find cocoa mass, you can substitute it with high-cocoa chocolate (like 90%).
Equipment

* Emersion circulator. I use an Anova, but any brand will do.
* Vacuum pouches + sealer. I use a fairly cheap vacuum sealer from Foodsaver.
* Waterbath, can be a large pan or plastic container.
* Saucepan to heat the cream.
* Stick blender (optional, but will result in smoother ice cream).
* Ice cream churner, I use a Smart Scoop from Breville. Available as the Sage Smart Scoop in Europe.

Note on sous vide: This recipe can also be made non-sous vide if you have access to a food thermometer. Instead of heating the mixture in a water bath, heat the mixture on the stove and keep it for 25 minutes at 72 °C. Heating the mixture on the stove will result in more evaporation; to counter this, you can increase the amount of cream with 10%. I haven’t tested the non-sous vide version, let me know your results in the comments!
Steps

* Heat the water bath, set the circulator to 72 °C (161.6F).
* Add milk and cream to the saucepan, heat until around 70 °C. Don’t let the mixture boil.
* Add the warm mixture to the chocolate in the vitamix container, let the chocolate melt (about 1 minute).
* Emulsify the cream-chocolate mixture with the vitamix on slow speed. Try to minimize bubbles forming.
* Add eggs into big bowl.
* Add sugar and salt to eggs gradually while stirring.
* Add milk powder. Mix well.
* Slowly incorporate the chocolate mixture into the eggs.
* Transfer the mixture to a vacuum bag.
* Seal the bag and add it to the water bath.
* Heat the mixture for 30 minutes at 72 °C.
* Remove the bag from the water bath and transfer to a bowl with ice water. Cool the mixture as fast as possible. You can also cool the bag under running water in the sink.
* Store the mixture in the bag in the fridge overnight.
* The next day, sieve the mixture and add one teaspoon of the vanilla extract by taste.
* Churn the ice cream according to the instructions of your ice cream machine.
* After churning, quickly transfer the ice cream to a pre-cooled storage container. Let the ice cream harden in the freezer, this takes roughly 3 hours.
